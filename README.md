# Rebook Project 

Welcome to the Rebook project repository! Rebook is an e-commerce platform specifically tailored for buying and selling used books.

## Overview

Rebook is built using the Django web framework for the backend. It provides users with the ability to upload books they want to sell and browse through a catalog of available books to purchase from other users. The platform facilitates the exchange of used books, allowing users to discover new reads while also providing a platform for selling books they no longer need.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- **Book Listing**: Users can upload details of books they want to sell, including title, author, description, condition, and price.
- **Book Search**: Users can search for books based on book name
- **User Profile**: Users can view and edit their profiles, including personal information and uploaded books.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins have access to an admin panel to manage users, books, orders, and site settings.
